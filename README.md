# Shopping_Data
This is a watered down version of a script desinged to give suggestions on product bidding and exposure based on relevant serach terms.
While this returns the basic information the actual program also retrieves internal product data as well as historical performance of the product to  help make decisions. It also calculates the average listing price and price difference between the competitors and the vendors listings. It also returns the share of views and clicks that the vendor recieved.
